# TartanHacks HackerHelp

This allows hackers to request a mentor to assist them with their projects, or help with specific problems.

Here are instructions on how you can use this repository:

1. [For Hackers](#hackers)
2. [For Mentors](#mentors)

## Hackers

1. Go to the [issues tab](https://github.com/ScottyLabs/HackerHelp/issues).
2. Click on the "New issue" button.
3. Give a descriptive title to what you would like a mentor to help you with.
    They can be specific technical problems:
   
    > Cannot load iOS frameworks for Facebook login API
    > OpenCV import difficulties

    for which someone knowledgeable about the technology will be able to assist you. Some of our sponsors are even bringing a few engineers along to assist you with their APIs!

    You can also ask more general project questions:

    > Can't decide between mobile and web app ideas
    > Need help planning division of labor

4. (optional) Add a more descriptive comment to give a little bit more detail about your problem if it isnt self explanatory. This would be a good place to include what you tried so far, or what you think the mentor could do specifically to help.
5. (optional) Add relevant labels for specific platforms, languages, etc.
6. Click "Submit"!

Once you have submitted your issue, mentors will be able to comment on it to
clarify things, and assign themselves to the issue to tell you that they are on
their way to help!
