# TartanHacks HackerHelp

This allows hackers to request a mentor to assist them with their projects, or help with specific problems.

Here are instructions on how you can use this repository:

1. [For Hackers](#hackers)
2. [For Mentors](#mentors)

> This is a brand new setup for us, if you need clarificaitons, or have
> suggestions for improvement, feel free to contact scott@scottylabs.org.

## Hackers

1. Go to the [issues tab](https://github.com/ScottyLabs/HackerHelp/issues).
2. Click on the "New issue" button.
3. Give a descriptive title to what you would like a mentor to help you with.
   They can be specific technical problems:

    > Cannot load iOS frameworks for Facebook login API
    > OpenCV import difficulties

    for which someone knowledgeable about the technology will be able to assist
    you. Some of our sponsors are even bringing a few engineers along to assist
    you with their APIs!

    You can also ask more general project questions:

    > Can't decide between mobile and web app ideas
    > Need help planning division of labor

4. **Add your location to the issue description**. If we don't know where you
   are, we can't help!
5. (optional) Add a more descriptive comment to give a little bit more detail
   about your problem if it isnt self explanatory. This would be a good place to
   include what you tried so far, or what you think the mentor could do
   specifically to help.
6. (optional) Add relevant labels for specific platforms, languages, etc.
7. Click "Submit"!

Once you have submitted your issue, mentors will be able to comment on it to
clarify things, and assign themselves to the issue to tell you that they are on
their way to help!

## Mentors

Thanks for mentoring! We're excited to try out this new system this year, we
hope it makes your experience better, as well as the hackers'.

Before the event, we need to get a little information from you to get you set up
with our mentor GitHub page and Slack channel.

1. Email tartanhacks@<span style="display: hidden">X</span>scottylabs.org with
   the following information:
   ```
   name: Your Name
   email: example@example.com
   github username: c00lname
   affiliation: (either CMU or sponsor company)
   ```
   If you don't have a [GitHub](https://github.com) account, it is free to sign up.
2. You will get a reply, hopefully promptly, to acknowledge that your message
   was received. This will be followed by emails from GitHub and
   [Slack](slack.com) adding you to the appropriate teams.
3. You may want to download the Slack app for your phone, which will be easier
   to use when you are moving around at the even.
4. Attend one of the pre-TartanHacks mentor meetings. To make sure we are all on
   the same page for the event, we will be holding a meeting or two beforehand
   to talk about how mentor assignments will work and to give some tips on how
   you can best help hackers.
